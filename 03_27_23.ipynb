        "In our last notebooks, we focused on field data recorded from a single electrode at the scalp (EEG) or in the brain (LFP). However, typical brain voltage recordings consist of multiple electrodes. For example, the standard EEG recording consists of [21 electrodes]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%E2%80%9320_system_(EEG)') spaced across the scalp surface, and sometimes many more. The number of electrodes utilized in invasive ECoG (electrocorticography) recordings also range from a handful of contacts to over 100 implanted electrodes. In this module, we continue our study of field data recorded from the cortical surface but now consider ECoG data recorded simultaneously from two electrodes during a task."

As part of her routine clinical workup before resective surgery, numerous electrodes were implanted [directly on the cortical surface]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocorticography'). The purpose of this invasive recording procedure was to monitor and localize her seizures for eventual surgical treatment. During this recording procedure, in which electrocorticogram (ECoG) electrodes were implanted and recordings performed for one week, the patient volunteered to participate in an auditory task study administered by a collaborating researcher. The task required the patient to listen to individual phonemes through headphones and respond with a button click whenever she heard the [phoneme]('https://www.jneurosci.org/content/30/49/16643') “ba” (the other phonemes were different, e.g., “pa,” ”ma”). The tone presentation was repeated 100 times, and her ECoG recorded (sampling rate 500 Hz) from two cortical electrodes over the auditory brain area for 1 s."
