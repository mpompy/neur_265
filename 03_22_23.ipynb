        "><b>Task:</b> We've looked at the ACC in mice, and found dominant oscillations within the cortical LFP. What about other brain regions? Might they have different patterns of oscillations? To check this, let's look at another area of the brain - the hippocampus. We'll look at the LFP signal from the dorsal hippocampus of a rat as it runs down a maze. To do this, upload the <code>rat_dhc.csv</code> file from our class GitHub repo as a <code>numpy</code> array. You should see that this array has only one row - this row corresponds to a single trial of the task the rat was doing in the maze. Each column corresponds to a sample. The sampling rate for these data is 2034 Hz. Calculate the power spectrum and a spectrogram for this sample. Are there any differences in the power spectrum between the hippocampus and cortex?"
