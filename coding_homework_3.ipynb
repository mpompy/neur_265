        "1. Make a *Markdown Cell* that contains the following information:\n",
        "- Your name (small header)\n",
        "- The name of this class (italicized)\n",
        "- The date (bolded)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Make a *Code Cell* that imports <code>numpy</code> as <code>np</code>, <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code> as <code>plt</code>, and <code>statistics</code> as <code>st</code>.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Make a *Code Cell* that imports your <code>v_rest1.csv</code> and <code>v_rest2.csv</code> variables as <code>numpy</code> arrays called <code>v_rest1</code> and <code>v_rest2</code> respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Make a *Code Cell* that does the following:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  a. Finds the means of <code>v_rest1</code> and <code>v_rest2</code>.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  b. Performs a t-test to test the null hypothesis that the means of <code>v_rest1</code> and <code>v_rest2</code> come from different distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "  c. Plots a histogram of <code>v_rest1</code> in one subplot, and a histogram of <code>v_rest2</code> in another subplot if the p-value of the t-test is > 0.05. You can make two subplots using the syntax <code>fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1)</code>.\n",
        "\n",
        "  d. Labels the y-axis and x-axis of your histograms (recall that <code>ax.ylabel</code> and <code>ax.xlabel</code> are the methods that let you accomplish this).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Make a *Code Cell* that defines a function called <code>vrestHist()</code>. This function should execute the code in step 4 when called. Remember to tell python that you want the function to show your plots when you call it!\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Make a *Code Cell* that calls <code>vrestHist()</code>.\n",

        "\n",
        "    a. Loops through each column of <code>v_rest1</code> and <code>v_rest2</code> and makes a scatter plot with <code>v_rest1</code> on the x-axis and <code>v_rest2</code> on the y-axis. \n",
        "\n",
        "    b. Each iteration of your loop should plot a different point on the scatter plot. At the end of your loop, you should have only one scatter plot with number of data points equal to the length of <code>v_rest1</code> and <code>v_rest2</code>.\n",
        "\n",
        "    c. Your loop should plot a <font color = 'red'>red</font> dot if *both* values in <code>v_rest1</code> and <code>v_rest2</code> are greater than -60, a <font color = 'green'>green</font> dot if values in <code>v_rest1</code> are greater than -60, but values in <code>v_rest2</code> are less than -60, and a <font color = 'blue'>blue</font> dot if *both* values in <code>v_rest1</code> and <code>v_rest2</code> are less than -60. \n",
        "\n",
        "    d. Labels your y-axis and your x-axis (this code should be outside of your loop).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Make a *Code Cell* that defines a function called <code>vrestScatter()</code>. This function should execute the code in step 7 when called. Remember to tell python that you want the function to show your plot when you call it!\n",
