        "Visual inspection of the EEG data has so far come up empty. The EEG traces appear noisy or perhaps rhythmic, but from visual inspection of the individual trials it’s difficult to make a decisive conclusion of underlying structurefig. To further investigate the activity in these data, we compute the event-related potential (ERP).\n",

        "To compute the ERP, we first assume that each trial evokes an instantiation of the same underlying brain process. So, in this case, we assume that the same brain response is evoked 1,000 times (once for each trial) for each condition. However, the evoked response due to the stimulus is small and hidden in the EEG signal by other ongoing activity unrelated to the stimulus (e.g., daydreaming, thoughts of dinner, thoughts of homework). Therefore, to tease out the weak evoked effect, we average the EEG responses across trials. Ideally, EEG activity unrelated to the stimulus will cancel out in the average, while EEG activity evoked by the stimulus will sum constructively. The procedure to perform and display this averaging can be done in Python as follows:"
