        "\n",
        "**Instructions**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Make a *Markdown Cell* that contains the following information:\n",
        "- Your name (small header)\n",
        "- The name of this class (italicized)\n",
        "- The date (bolded)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Create a *Code Cell* that imports relevant modules - specifically, <code>pandas as pd</code>, <code>matplotlib.pyplot as plt</code>, and <code>scipy.stats as stats</code>.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. For this assignment, you'll be using the <code>patch_seq_expanded.csv</code> file located in our class GitHub repo. Create a *Code Cell* that loads this file in as a <code>Pandas dataFrame</code> called <code>patch_seq</code>. \n",
        "\n",
        "4. In a new *Code Cell*, run the following line of code to get rid of empty values:\n",
        "\n",
        "<code>patch_seq['ISI'] = patch_seq['ISI'].fillna(0)</code>\n",
        "\n",
        "5. In a new *Code Cell*, using the <code>df.plot</code> method from the <code>pandas</code> module, make a bar graph that displays the value counts (how many observations) from the \"Marker\" column of your <code>patch_seq</code> variable. Label your x and y-axes.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. In a new *Code Cell*, repeat step 4, but make a pie chart instead of a bar graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. In a new *Code Cell*, use a <code>for</code> loop to make a scatter plot of the \"ISI\" (on the x-axis) and \"Fast_Trough\" (on the y-axis) values in your <code>patch_seq</code> dataframe. Your loop should make data points from \"Sst\" neurons <font color = 'red'>red</font>, and data points from \"Pvalb\" neurons <font color = 'blue'>blue</font>.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. In a new *Code Cell*, create a <code>function</code> called <code>patchScatter()</code> that will output the scatter plot created in step 6 when you call it. Don't forget to tell it to show your scatter plot!\n",
        "\n",
        "9. In a new *Code Cell*, return the mean, standard deviation, and range of the \"Fast_Trough\" column for \"Sst\" neurons and \"Pvalb\" neurons. You can do this with the <code>pandas</code> method <code>describe</code>, like so:\n",
        "\n",
        "<code>patch_seq.groupby('Marker')['Fast_Trough'].describe()</code>\n",
        "\n",
        "10. In a new *Markdown Cell*, describe the difference in means between \"Sst\" neurons and \"Pvalb\" neurons. Which group has a more negative undershoot following an action potential? \n",
        "\n",
        "11. In a new *Code Cell*, return the skewness of the \"Fast_Trough\" column for \"Sst\" neurons and \"Pvalb\" neurons. You can do this with the <code>pandas</code> method <code>skew</code> (follow the syntax in step 8 to apply this method to <code>patch_seq</code>).\n",
        "\n",
        "12. In a new *Markdown Cell*, interpret the results of your skewness test. Generally, values >0.5, or <-0.5, indicate a skewed distribution, while values between -0.5 and 0.5 indicate a normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. In a new *Code Cell*, repeat step 10 for the \"ISI\" column of <code>patch_seq</code>. \n",
        "\n",
        "14. In a new *Markdown Cell*, repeat step 11 for the \"ISI\" column of <code>patch_seq</code>. \n",
        "\n",
        "15. Finally, in a new *Code Cell*, let's perform a t-test to see if our \"Fast_Trough\" and \"ISI\" values differ between \"Sst\" and \"Pvalb\" neurons. To do this for our \"Fast_Trough\" values, we should first isolate each group and make each of them into a separate variable. An example of how to do this for \"Sst\" neurons is below:\n",
        "\n",
        "<code>sst_neurons = patch_seq[patch_seq['Marker']=='Sst']</code>\n",
        "\n",
        "Use the same code to create another variable called <code>pvalb_neurons</code>. Once you've made your two variables, perform an independent-samples t-test to compare \"Fast_Trough\" values between the two groups:\n",
        "\n",
        "<code>stats.ttest_ind(sst_neurons['Fast_Trough'], pvalb_neurons['Fast_Trough'])</code>.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. In a *Markdown Cell*, describe the results of your t-test. Does the undershoot voltage significantly differ betwen the two groups?\n",
        "\n",
        "17. In a new *Code Cell*, repeat step 14 for \"ISI\". You won't need to create new <code>sst_neurons</code> and <code>pvalb_neurons</code> variables - you'll just need to run a new t-test. \n",
        "\n",
        "18. In a new *Markdown Cell*, repeat step 15 for the results of your new t-test.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Make sure to put a <code>#</code> in each *Code Cell* to describe what it does.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Save a copy of this notebook to your GitHub repo with the title <code>coding_homework_4.ipynb</code>.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n"
