        "DNA makes RNA makes Protein. This “Central Dogma” of molecular biology is a fundamental concept in molecular biology. With the development of DNA sequencing, we can explore the genome - all of the DNA in an organism. However, DNA is only the starting point. To understand what genes are active, and under what circumstances, we have to know what genes are being transcribed into messenger RNA. Starting from the first cell - in, for example, a human or a mouse - every other cell differentiates itself not by having different DNA, but by expressing (transcribing) those genes differently. A cell in the liver has the same DNA instructions as a neuron in the brain. However the genes being expressed differ greatly between these cells. The sum of all RNAs being expressed in a cell is known as the transcriptome."

        "\n",
        "1. RNA is extracted from an organism of interest. Choices must be made at this stage about sampling of the organisms, since not all RNAs of interest may be present in every tissue and at all times. RNA is also easily degraded, and the extraction procedure can introduce biases into the collected sample. How we extract samples defines our experimental design. Typically we will sample at least two distinct groups (e.g. wild-type/mutant, healthy/disease, or control/experimental). We also will have several biological replicates since all our sampling will contain biases.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Several biochemical steps are taken to prepare extracted RNA into a sequencing library. RNA is converted into stable cDNA and undesired RNA (e.g. ribosomal RNA) is removed. Adaptors are attached to the cDNAs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. There are a variety of sequencing platforms that can generate the sequence of a prepared library. In the popular illumina protocol, millions of short cDNA fragments will be generated (usually 100-300bp in size).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Following sequencing, the RNA-Seq reads are quality controlled and then software is used to align and or assemble these reads for further analysis."

Brain tissue is heterogenous, containing many different types of cells (astrocytes, neurons, interneurons, *Pval* neurons, *Sst* neurons, etc.). Typical bulk RNA-sequencing strategies do not capture how the transcriptome might vary between these cell types. In order to analyze cell type-specific gene expression, we need to employ a technique called single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). "
