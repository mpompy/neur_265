Specifically, phase coherence assesses the degree to which two oscillations *within the same frequency band* might co-vary over time. We saw, however, when using the Fourier transform to de-construct our complex signals, that real LFP and EEG signals contain oscillations in many different frequency bands.

Cross-frequency coupling been observed in many brain regions, has been shown to change in time with task demands, and has been proposed to serve a [functional role]('https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3359652/') in working memory, neuronal computation, communication, and learning. Although the cellular and dynamic mechanisms of specific rhythms associated with CFC are relatively well understood, the mechanisms governing interactions between different frequency rhythms - and the appropriate techniques for measuring CFC - remain active research areas. Although we consider only a single electrode recording here, we note that these techniques can be extended to association measures between electrodes as well.\n",
