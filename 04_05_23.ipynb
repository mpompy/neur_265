        "In our last notebook, we used visualization methods and simple interspike interval models to describe the spiking properties of a retinal neuron that was maintained at constant light and environmental conditions. In other words, we examined a neuron that was firing on its own, without any explicit driving stimuli. In contrast, many neuroscience experiments involve stimulating or perturbing a neural system and recording changes in spiking activity of a set of neurons in response to that stimulus. The stimulation may be a simple signal applied directly to the neural system, such as a current pulse injected into a neuron. Or it may be a more complex or abstract stimulus that is sensed in the peripheral nervous system and influences neural activity elsewhere, such as the presentation of a movie composed of a natural scene to an awake animal, inducing activity patterns in primary visual cortex and downstream areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "This stimulus-response paradigm relates to the important concept of neural coding: that statistical features of spiking activity contain information about the stimuli, behaviors, or other biological signals that influence the activity. From a data analysis perspective, we are interested in modeling the relation between these signals and the observed spiking activity. We can do so through a statistical spike train model. Here we explore a useful class of models based on the statistical theory of point processes. We define the models in terms of a Poisson rate function, which defines the instantaneous likelihood of observing a spike at any point in time as a function of a set of covariates. In particular, we use a class of point process models that can be fitted by maximum likelihood and whose estimators have multiple optimal properties. These are called generalized linear models (GLMs). We provide some basic statistical ideas to develop intuition about these types of models, but readers can explore the rich theory underlying this approach via the references mentioned in this notebook."

The length of `maze_spikes` is the total number of spikes to occur during the duration of the recording: 220 spikes. Therefore, the first step to visualizing the place-specific spiking activity is to use `maze_spikes` to create a new vector, with the same size as `maze_coordinates`, that indicates whether a spike was fired at each time bin.

To do so, we define a set of position bins spanning the full 100 cm track, count the number of spikes that occur in each location bin, and divide by the occupancy, the total amount of time spent at each location bin. Dividing by the occupancy is important. Otherwise differences in the way the stimulus is presented can bias the characterization of the stimulus response relation. For example, if the rat spent much more time in the 50–80 cm region, we might expect more firing in that region even if the firing does not depend on place at all. Based on our previous visualization, we know that this is not the case for these data, but it is important to keep in mind how the statistics of a stimulus signal might influence the statistics of an output signal."

Spike counts can take on only non-negative integer values, so their distribution cannot be normal.

        "It is likely that we could refine this model further, perhaps by adding additional covariates or including different dependence structure on the covariates we are currently using. The process of model refinement is not about identifying a single correct model. Instead, it is about building a model that sufficiently captures features of the data in which we are interested. For this analysis, let’s decide that based on our multiple goodness-of-fit tools, Model 4 is good enough. We now use this model to better understand the structure of the place cell that generated these data.\n",

It was clear from the initial visualizations that this neuron’s firing activity is position sensitive; it is more likely to fire when the animal is at certain positions than others. Our modeling analysis further showed that this position dependence could be well described by an exponentiated quadratic function of position, that is, a Gaussian-shaped function.\n",
