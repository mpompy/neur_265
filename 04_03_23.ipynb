The most common type of neural signal that falls into this category is the action potential. Recall that action potentials are *all-or-none* events - they either happen, or they don't. When recording action potentials (another word for action potentials is \"spikes\") in a behaving animal, we therefore just have to have some way of detecting their presence. "

Neurons in the retina typically respond to patterns of light displayed over small sections of the visual field. However, when retinal neurons are grown in culture and held under constant light and environmental conditions, they will still spontaneously fire action potentials. In a fully functioning retina, this spontaneous activity is sometimes described as background firing activity, which is modulated as a function of visual stimuli. It is useful to understand the properties of this background activity in order to determine in future experiments how these firing properties are affected by specific stimuli."

At first glance, your answer might be “not much.” Spikes occur fairly regularly throughout the 5 s interval under both conditions. Perhaps a careful visual inspection suggests there are fewer spikes in the low-light than in the high-light condition. But the spike times themselves do not seem to be directly comparable between these conditions. Often, when we examine data from a stimulus response experiment, we expect to see regions where spiking activity increases or decreases as a function of a changing stimulus. In this case, the stimulus is the ambient light level, which remains constant over the entire experiment. How else can we analyze these data and identify differences in the spiking activity (if any) between the two conditions?"

This is to be expected; the intervals between spikes cannot be negative. Both histograms also show broad peaks at 5–20 ms, indicating that a large number of short ISIs appear in the spike trains. In addition, both histograms possess long tails (i.e., counts of ISIs at larger bins, beyond 50 ms). A reasonable conclusion is that both neurons exhibit bursting activity, intervals of rapid spiking separated by periods of quiescence. However, a prominent difference exists between the ISI histograms in the two conditions. In the high-light condition, the proportion of small ISIs is much larger. The visualizations of the ISI histograms provide additional evidence of the similarities and differences in the spiking activity from the two conditions.

        "Another common approach to analyzing spiking data is to discretize time into bins of fixed width and count the number of events that occur in each time bin. The sequence of spike counts across all the bins is sometimes called the increment process for the spike train. When the time bins are sufficiently small, say, 1 ms for typical spike train data, the resulting increment process is just a sequence of zeros and ones. In this case, the time bins are so small that the probability of more than one spike occurring in each bin is zero or negligibly small. Each tiny time bin then contains a spike (and we assign that bin a value of 1) or does not (and we assign that bin a value of 0). In this section, we compute the increment process with multiple bin sizes in order to characterize the amount of variability in the spiking data and to examine temporal dependencies between spikes.\n",

In the first, consider a neuron that fires perfectly regularly, like a metronome. In this case, we expect the number of spikes in each time bin to be nearly identical. On the other hand, consider the scenario of a neuron that fires in irregular bursts. In this case, we expect much more variability in the number of spikes in each time bin, depending on whether a time bin contained a burst of spikes or a quiet period. To characterize this variability, a standard measure to compute is the sample Fano factor (FF). It’s easy to define the Fano factor: FF is the sample variance of the increment process divided by the sample mean of the increment process.

In other words, the probability of a neuron spiking at any instant does not depend on when the neuron fired (or did not fire) previously. A useful way to conceptualize this process is as a coin flip. For example, consider the following outcome of 20 coin flips:\n",

However, the Poisson process has many nice theoretical properties that make it a good model against which to compare the data. For example, for any Poisson process, the number of spikes in any time interval has a Poisson probability distribution for which the theoretical variance and mean are equal"

In this case, spiking activity in the past is influencing the neuron to spike in a more predictable manner in subsequent bins.

To do this, we'll need to define time bins, and then find spikes that occur within each bin. Once we have the number of spikes in each bin, we can calculate the firing rate for that bin by dividing the number of spikes by the bin size (recall that the unit for firing rate, \"Hz\", is a measure of the number of spikes that occur per second).
